This repository contains the R code used to run the analyses and generate plots of both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets of the publication "RNA-sequencing reveals predominance of THRA splicing isoform 2 in developing and adult human brain".\
\
The files have been named according to the same coding of the paper (D1, D2.. D6)\
D1, D2, D3 and D4 -> bulk RNA-seq\
D5, D6 -> single cell RNA-seq
